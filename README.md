# Approach Avoidance Conflict Task (AACT)

## Description

To start the task run the aact.py script. The task requires 10 provoking images and 10 neutral images to be placed on the Desktop. If needed, a sample of images can be found in media/images/provocation-images. Copy the provocation-images directory to the Desktop to run the task with generic images. The subject ID needs to be whatever the folder name inside provocation-images/ is. Currently the example images are under the subject id: test.
